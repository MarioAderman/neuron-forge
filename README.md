# 🧠 Neuron Forge - ML from Scratch Playground

Welcome to **Neuron Forge - ML from Scratch Playground** — a self-made mini framework inspired by `scikit-learn`, built using only **NumPy** and **matplotlib**.

This project is both a **learning tool** and a **technical playground**, designed to deepen your understanding of how classic machine learning models work under the hood. No black boxes here — every line of `fit()` and `predict()` is written from scratch.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Manually implement core ML models
- Understand key mathematical and algorithmic foundations
- Build a reusable framework with clean, modular code
- Visualize learning processes and decision boundaries
- Turn it into a Jupyter-based learning lab

---

## ✅ What You'll Learn

- 🔢 **Linear Regression**: Least squares, gradients, vectorized implementation
- 🚦 **Logistic Regression**: Sigmoid, binary classification, cost functions
- 🌳 **Decision Trees**: Recursive splits, entropy, Gini index
- ➕ **Bonus**: Support Vector Machines, regularization, and more
